## Description

The goal of this project was to build the back end for an e-commerce site. I took a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Usage

After installing the node modules, connecting to the Sequelize database, installing the schema, node seeds and activating the server the user will be able to test all of the API routes in Insomnia Core to manipulate the database.

## Credits

I was able to complete the assignment through tutoring from my fellow peer [Myro Lee](https://github.com/myrojoylee)!
